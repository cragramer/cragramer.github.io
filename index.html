      <strong>The Optimal File Size of Private Information Retrieval and Secret Sharing</strong><br>
      School of Science and Engineering, CUHK-Shenzhen<br>
      Apr 2023 - now<br>
      Supervisor: Zitan Chen<br>
      - Identified the smallest possible file size for the rate-optimal byzantine-resistant communication-efficient secret sharing scheme<br>
      - Disproved the findings of "Communication Efficient Secret Sharing With Small Share Size" by demonstrating the incorrectness of their claim regarding achieving a smaller share size and decoding delay<br>
      - Confirmed the optimality of the file size had been achieved in the scheme proposed by "Communication Efficient Secret Sharing"<br>
      - Investigated the lower file size bound for balanced capacity-achieving private information retrieval file size, thus establishing a minimum file size requirement for balanced capacity-achieving private information retrieval

      <strong>Communication Efficient Secret Sharing and Multi-Party Computation</strong><br>
      School of Science and Engineering, CUHK-Shenzhen<br>
      Jul 2022 - Mar 2023<br>
      Supervisor: Zitan Chen<br>
      - Explored the properties and characteristics of secret-sharing schemes with optimal communication bandwidth and information rate<br>
      - Designed and proposed a matrix-based approach inspired by the research presented in "Communication Efficient Secret Sharing",
      aiming to make the scheme applicable for computer program implementation<br>
      - Referenced the book "Secure Multiparty Computation and Secret Sharing" and "Lecture Notes in Secret Sharing" to gain further insights
      and deepen understanding in the field
